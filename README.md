# Problems Solved

```
- Connecting medical experts around the world. 

- Doctors and medical professionals in the urban regions can network amongst each other with relative ease. 

- However rural areas often face a communication gap to exchange expertise. 

- Due to this gap, patients in rural regions often face issues with accurate diagnosis.

- Through our platform we aim to better connect doctors and medical professionals so that patients are benefitted and medical opinions are verified and updated.

- We aim to maximize medical staff presence on our website to bridge communication gap and encourage collaborative opinion sharing.
